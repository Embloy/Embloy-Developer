# iOS SDK

Integrate Embloy’s prebuilt payment UI into the application process of your iOS app with the `ApplicationSheet` class. See our sample integration [on GitHub](https://github.com/embloy/embloy-examples).

:::info
The Embloy iOS SDK are currently under development and not released yet. However, the documentation is already set up, so that you can get a glimpse of what's coming.
:::

## Set up Embloy

First, you need an Embloy account. [Register now](https://embloy.com/register).

### Server-side

This integration requires endpoints on your server that talk to the Embloy API. Use our official libraries for access to the Embloy API from your server. See also the [Server-side SDKs](/docs/sdks/overview.mdx#server-side-sdks).

### Client-side

The Embloy iOS SDK is open source, fully documented, and compatible with apps supporting iOS 13 or above.
