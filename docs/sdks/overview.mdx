# Embloy SDKs

Libraries and tools for interacting with your Embloy integration.

## Server-side SDKs

Embloy's server-side helper libraries (also known as server-side SDKs) reduce the amount of work required to use Embloy’s REST APIs, starting with reducing the boilerplate code you have to write. Below are the installation instructions for these libraries in a variety of popular server-side programming languages.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ruby"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'Java', value: 'java'},
    {label: 'Node', value: 'node'},
    {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="ruby">
```bash title="Command Line"
# Available as a gem
sudo gem install embloy
```

```ruby title="Gemfile"
# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile
gem 'embloy'
```

```ruby title="app/controllers/your-controller.rb"
# Replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN' with your actual client token
session = {
    mode: "job",
    job_slug: "job#1",
    success_url: "mypage.com/success",
    cancel_url: "mypage.com/failure"
}
client = Embloy::Client.new('YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN', session)
redirect_url = client.make_request
redirect_to redirect_url
```
</TabItem>

You can access certain Embloy products and features in the beta stage with beta SDKs. The versions of these beta SDKs have the beta or b suffix, for example, 0.1.0b3 in Python and 0.1.0-beta.3 in other language SDKs. Try these beta SDKs and share feedback with us before the features reach the stable phase. To learn more about how to use the beta SDKs, read the readme file in the GitHub repository of the individual language SDKs.

## Web SDKs

Embloy provides the following web client SDKs to enable integrations with Embloy Elements, our prebuilt UI components, to create an application form that lets you process an application without getting your hands dirty.

<WebSDKRow />
```

## Mobile device SDKs

Our mobile device helper libraries (also known as Mobile device SDKs) help you create native applications for Apple’s and Android’s devices and platforms. The React Native SDK helps you integrate Embloy into iOS and Android applications built with React Native.
