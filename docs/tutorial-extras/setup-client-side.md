# Client-Side

Update your client to call the `make_request` endpoint:

```JavaScript title="your-api/server.js"
<a className="App-link" href="https://<your-web-sevice>/api/make_request">Apply with EMBLOY</a>
```

When pressing on "Apply with EMBLOY", a user is now redirected to Embloy's application portal.
