# Introduction

___"Embloy-Core is PayPal, but for jobs and job-applications instead of transactions."___

## What is Embloy Core?

#### One application tool to rule them all:

- Improves user experience when applying for jobs (no need to sign up for each job-provider's job platform and have to keep track of multiple application systems - just one Embloy account and nothing more)
- Centralized application management
- Comes with several smart hiring tools to help you save time when reviewing applications

## Who is it for?

Embloy-Core has two use cases:

#### 1. The job provider side

- Simplify hiring procedures
- Increase applications
- Share job positions more easily on social media platforms
- Integrate Embloy Genius ranking features to help finding the best candidates for the position
- Allow users to apply for your job with just one-click 
- Assurance that only verified "real" users apply for jobs

#### 2. The applicant side

- Centralized application tool instead of annoying email-threads and having to sign in to a new job-portal for every new job posting.
- Apply with one click
- Track all pending application and automatic notification of status changes and replies

## How much does it cost?

For applicants, embloy is 100% free. Job providers can request a basic subscription for an application if they want to verify that a user is "real" in which case the applicant will have to subscribe to Embloy-Free (= free tier, 0.00 EUR/month).

From the job-provider side, most Embloy services can be used for free, but for verification, the job-provider has to be subscribed to one of the following:

- **Embloy-Free: 0.00 EUR/month**
- **Embloy-Smart: 50.00 EUR/month**
- **Embloy-Genius** - _coming soon_

Subscriptions are per default on a monthly basis, but can be customized to be dependent on API use. For more information, see the [subscription documentation](https://developers.embloy.com/docs/category/subscriptions). 

Embloy partners with Stripe for simplified billing.
