# Introduction

___"Embloy-Core is PayPal, but for jobs and job applications instead of transactions."___

## What is Embloy Core?

> #### The analogy: _"PayPal for Jobs"_

Much like **PayPal** facilitates electronic money transfers and secure transactions between users and payment networks like Mastercard or Visa, **Embloy** functions as a middleware/SaaS layer atop existing job platforms such as Greenhouse, WorkDayJobs, or Successfactors. It simplifies and secures the application process, allowing users to apply with a single click directly from the employer's preferred job page.

> #### One application tool to rule them all

- Improves the user experience when applying for jobs (no need to sign up for each job provider's job platform and have to keep track of multiple application systems - just one **Embloy** account and nothing more)
- Centralized application management
- Includes several smart hiring tools and integrations to help you save time when reviewing applications
