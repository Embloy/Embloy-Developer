# Account blacklisted


## What should you do if you've been blacklisted?

- You should have received an email explaining the reason for which you were banned from our services. In case this didn't happen, please reach out to us using these [customer contact forms](https://about.embloy.com/contact)

- Do you think it was a bug? Please report it to us on GitHub (see [here](https://github.com/embloy))

:::important
Please report sensitive security issues via Embloy's bug-bounty program by writing us an email to feedback@embloy.com rather than GitHub.

## Next steps

- If you think that you have been blacklisted by mistake and have already written to our customer support, please wait for a response from our customer support. If you do not receive a reply within 14 days, please contact us again.
