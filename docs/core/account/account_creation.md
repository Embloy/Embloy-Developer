# Create a new Embloy account

_You're one small step away from using Embloy!_

## Create a new Embloy account via the web-app

Users can set up an account with their email address and password, or choose to log in using the OAuth2.0 services
provided by Google and GitHub and soon LinkedIn and Microsoft (see [embloy.com/register](https://embloy.com/register)). 

:::info
When creating an account or logging in using OAuth2.0, the account is automatically linked to your profile.
:::

Passwords are instantly hashed using [bcryt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) and stored in the database as a
hash. In case a user forgets their password, it can be reset via standard email authentication.

For an optimal user experience, it is recommended to fill out the 'Preferences' field under 'My Profile'.
To log into the application, users can use the aforementioned OAuth2.0 services or enter their password.
If a user forgets their password, they can reset it by providing their email address and following the specified
procedure in the email.

## Activate account via web-app

Once an account is created, it needs to be activated by clicking on the activation link sent by email.

That's it. _Welcome to Embloy!_
