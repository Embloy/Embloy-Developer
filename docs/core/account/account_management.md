# Manage account

Decide how to be seen by your employers and applicants.

## Updating account information

You can customize your profile's information by checking out [the settings page](https://embloy.com/dashboard/settings) or by using [this endpoint](https://www.postman.com/embloy/workspace/embloy-workspace/request/24977803-a962de05-cf83-4c29-8495-1bdacf06454d).

## Personal details

All your profile information is by default private for other Embloy users, besides when you apply for a job or want to post a job. In that case, your name, account verification status and (if you enable it) your email and address will also be shown. 

## Upload profile image

Currently, you can upload a profile image, which will be shown to other users using [this endpoint](https://www.postman.com/embloy/workspace/embloy-workspace/request/24977803-1f248aac-ce80-4543-8671-034c8d351188).
