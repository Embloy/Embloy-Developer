# Subscription information

For applicants, Embloy is 100% free. Job providers can request a basic subscription for an application if they want to verify that a user is "real" in which case the applicant will have to subscribe to Embloy-Free (= free tier, 0.00 EUR/month).

From the job-provider side, to verify the account and access special features, the job-provider has to be subscribed to one of the following:

- **Embloy-Free: 0.00 EUR/month**
- **Embloy-Smart: 50.00 EUR/month**
- **Embloy-Genius: 500.00 EUR/month**

:::tip
Subscriptions are by default on a monthly basis but can be customized to be dependent on API use.
:::

Embloy partners with Stripe for simplified billing.

:::note
Sandbox users cannot perform any subscription-related actions (such as creating a new subscription or managing billing information). They only have access to a limited set of features.
