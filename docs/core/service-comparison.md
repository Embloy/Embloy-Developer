# Scenario comparison

Determine if Embloy is the right fit for your needs.

:::important
When comparing different scenarios, remember that Embloy is designed as an add-on to build on top of your existing systems. However, if you don't have any ATS systems in place, Embloy can also function as a standalone system.

## Who is it for?

### Scenario 1:

> _You're a small company with a simple HTML website, a few open job positions, and no ATS tools in place. You accept applications via email or LinkedIn._

[**Embloy-Smart**](./subscriptions/subscription_features.md#embloy-smart) is an ideal choice for you. It can be easily integrated with [Genius-Queries](./genius_queries.md), supports up to 50 active job listings, and can function as a standalone ATS system at no extra cost.

### Scenario 2:

> _You're a small to medium-sized company with a complex job page (perhaps linked to your backend) and dozens of open job positions. You have a custom application system._

[**Embloy-Smart**](./subscriptions/subscription_features.md#embloy-smart) is perfect for you. It integrates using [Quicklink](./quicklink/quicklink_application.md), supports up to 50 active job listings, and can be used on top of your existing application system.

### Scenario 3:

> _You're a medium- to large-sized company with a fully integrated and efficient application processing system (e.g., Greenhouse, Successfactors, Workdayjobs, Join, ...) and hundreds of rapidly changing open job positions._

[**Embloy-Genius**](./subscriptions/subscription_features.md#embloy-genius) is ideal for you. It integrates and automates using [Quicklink](./quicklink/quicklink_application.md), supports unlimited active job listings, and can be easily integrated into popular ATS systems using our [SDKs](./../sdks/overview.mdx) and [Embloy Genius](/docs/guides/get-started-integrations) integration features.

## Who is it NOT for?

### Scenario 1:

> _You're an individual or a very small team that manages a low volume of applications manually and prefers a more hands-on approach._

Embloy's automation and integration features may not be necessary for your needs. A simpler solution or manual processing might be more suitable.

### Scenario 2:

> _You're a company that does not hire frequently or has unique hiring processes that may not align with standard application management tools._

While we strive to offer a flexible and customizable application process, if your hiring process is infrequent or highly unique, Embloy might not be the best fit.
