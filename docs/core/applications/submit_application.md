# Submit a new application

_All it takes is one click._

## Duplicate Applications

Depending on the job, you might be allowed to apply twice for the same job. In this case, the application process is the same as usual. You can track your different applications submitted for a single job posting by opening the Applications Dashboard, selecting an application and pressing on the different application version buttons. Per default, Embloy always shows you the latest application version for a given application.

:::note
If you apply to a job posting hosted by an external ATS provider, duplicate applications are per default allowed.
:::

## Apply via Application Proxy

To apply via the [Application Proxy](../../application-proxy.mdx), just open [apply.embloy.com](https://apply.embloy.com) and paste the URL of the job posting you want to apply to.

## Apply using Quicklink

For the employer's perspective, see the [Quicklink documentation](../quicklink/quicklink_application.md) for more details.

From the applicant's perspective, all you have to do to apply is press the "Apply with Embloy" button.

To apply manually using Quicklink, you can use [this endpoint](https://www.postman.com/embloy/workspace/embloy-workspace/request/24977803-d30ba0ba-7c54-4b48-a24f-da3741125391).

## Apply using Embloy-Jobfinder

> For public jobs listed on Embloy's Jobfinder, you can apply directly on embloy.com.

Optionally, the employer can choose to require you to answer additional questions (single choice, multiple choice, date, number, long text, short text, location) or upload additional documents (e.g., a CV or Video). If this is the case, make sure to upload documents matching the required format, as the application can't be successfully submitted otherwise.

:::warning
Proofread your application carefully, as you won't be able to change it once it has been uploaded.
