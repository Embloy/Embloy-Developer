# Own applications

You can see applications submitted by you on your [main dashboard page](https://embloy.com/dashboard/applications). There, you can review your application status (_pending_, _accepted_ or _rejected_). Once an application is accepted, the job will automatically be moved to the [upcoming jobs panel](https://embloy.com/dashboard).

If you click on an application, you can see the current application status, your application message and your application attachments (if uploaded when applying).

If you want to fetch your applications manually, you can use [this endpoint](https://www.postman.com/embloy/workspace/embloy-workspace/request/24977803-113dd00e-6c6e-42a5-ba20-3291ff75dcaf).
