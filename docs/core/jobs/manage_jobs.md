# Manage jobs

All about features related to jobs on Embloy.

## Your jobs

If you want to find all jobs created by you manually, you can use [this endpoint](https://www.postman.com/embloy/workspace/embloy-workspace/request/24977803-0214db05-841a-452d-bad9-19e0a0187e6a).

### Job visibility

Jobs have three different visibility status values:

- `Public`

- `Private`

- `Archived`

:::info
When creating a job, you can set the visibility. The default visibility is `public`.

### Job activation and deactivation

Whenever you create a new job, it is automatically activated. In case we notice suspicious activity on your job, or it does not conform to our terms of service, we can deactivate it. If your job is deactivated, this doesn't mean that it is deleted, but only you can still access it and won't be accessible for other users.

### Find a specific job

If you want to find a specific job manually, you can use [this endpoint](https://www.postman.com/embloy/workspace/embloy-workspace/request/24977803-c2661a5f-45ec-404f-81d6-f05b112ef1cc).

### Update your job

You can update all jobs created by you by clicking on one of your jobs and going to the "edit" page. Generally, you can update all fields (e.g., title, description, address, visibility, ...) besides the job activation- and deactivation status.

## Jobs you applied for

## Upcoming jobs

All jobs for which you successfully applied for and were accepted can be seen in the "upcoming jobs" section of your Embloy dashboard. Per default, this is the first screen that you see when logging into your Embloy account.
