# How to create jobs

:::note
To create jobs, you need to have a valid Embloy subscription. For normal jobs, _Embloy-Free_ is also sufficient.

## Automatically create jobs with Quicklink

If you have your own job page and integrated _Embloy Quicklink_, you don't need to worry about job creation as we automatically create a private (only visible to you and applicants using the "Apply with Embloy" Button on your page) job listing on Embloy which you can access just as usual via the job dashboard.

Read more on this in the [Quicklink documentation](https://developers.embloy.com/docs/core/quicklink/quicklink_application).
