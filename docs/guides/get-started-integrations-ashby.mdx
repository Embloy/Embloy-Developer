## Usage

- After connecting your ATS, applications submitted via Embloy will be automatically sent to Ashby for your usual processing. You can respond to candidates, and they will see updates in Embloy, such as interview invitations.
- It shouldn't be necessary but you can also access our [recruiter portal](https://genius.embloy.com/) for managing Embloy checking applications, and responding to candidates. Consider this an option for emergency or troubleshooting purposes.

So in conclusion, Embloy is built to be fully operational out of Ashby. Recruiting teams can continue using Ashby without additional effort if candidates apply through Embloy.
