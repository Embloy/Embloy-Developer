## Conclusion

### Receive applications via your ATS

- Now that you have connected your ATS, applications submitted through Embloy will automatically be sent there so that you can process your applications as usual.

:::tip
Applications submitted through Embloy will include an `Embloy` tag in your Lever dashboard.
:::

- If you need to, you can also log into our [recruiter portal](https://genius.embloy.com/), screen the applications and respond to the candidates directly. However, if you are using Embloy as an integration and not as a standalone tool, we recommend you to manage your applications directly via your ATS.
