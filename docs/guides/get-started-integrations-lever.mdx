Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Embloy! We are excited to have you on board. This guide will explain every step you need to take to connect Embloy with Lever.

---

## Prerequisites

- You are currently using [Lever](https://lever.co)

---

## Step 1: Create an account

If you haven't already, you can create an Embloy account by visiting our [registration page](https://embloy.com/register). You can also sign up using your Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, or GitHub accounts.

After you have created an account, you will receive a confirmation email. Click on the link in the email to verify your account.

## Step 3: Set up the integration

    - Go to **Settings** > [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations).

3. To synchronize the application stage of a candidate, please enable the _Candidate stage change_, _Candidate archive state change_, _Candidate hired_, _Interview created_, _Interview updated_ and _Interview deleted_ webhooks in Lever by going to **Settings** \> **Integrations and API** \> [**Webhooks**](https://hire.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=webhooks).
    :::tip
    If the webhooks don't appear in Lever's [**Webhooks**](https://hire.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=webhooks)-tab, you can reset them manually by clicking the _Reset Webhooks_-icon in the [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations)-tab of Embloy's Recruiter Dashboard.
    :::

    ![Lever Webhook Page](/img/integrations/lever/lever-webhooks.png)

:::warning
Since Lever doesnâ€™t provide a webhook for updates of your postingsâ€™ application forms, we automatically fetch your jobs every 12 hours.

Whenever you create or edit a posting, and you donâ€™t want to wait for it to re-synchronize automatically, you can trigger this manually by pressing the â€˜Refresh postingsâ€™-icon in the [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations)-tab of Embloyâ€™s Recruiter Dashboard.
:::

## Step 4: Adding 'Apply with Embloy' to your Job Postings

Let candidates know they can use Embloy to apply for your jobs! Update your templates and your existing postings with the following text that links to `https://apply.embloy.com/lever`: 
> **To apply faster, use [Embloy](https://embloy.com). Just paste the URL of this page into [*apply.embloy.com/lever*](https://apply.embloy.com/lever) or add *apply.embloy.com/* before the entire URL in your browser.**

#### VoilÃ , Embloy is now up and running!

## Usage
:::tip
Applications submitted through Embloy will include an `Embloy` tag in your Lever dashboard.
:::

- After connecting your ATS, applications submitted via Embloy will be automatically sent to Lever for your usual processing. You can respond to candidates, and they will see updates in Embloy, such as interview invitations.
- It shouldn't be necessary but you can also access our [recruiter portal](https://genius.embloy.com/) for managing Embloy checking applications, and responding to candidates. Consider this an option for emergency or troubleshooting purposes.

So in conclusion, Embloy is built to be fully operational out of Lever. Recruiting teams can continue using Lever without additional effort if candidates apply through Embloy.
