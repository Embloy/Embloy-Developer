## Prerequisites

- You are currently using [Lever](https://lever.co)

## Step 1: Create an account

## Step 3: Setting up the integration

:::note
If anything is unclear, follow the instructions shown in your ATS and if necessary, see their documentation and guides.
:::

1. Navigate to the [Embloy Recruiters Dashboard](https://genius.embloy.com).
    - Go to **Settings** > [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations).
    - Find Lever in the list and switch the toggle to activate the integration.

3. To synchronize the application stage of a candidate, please enable the _Candidate stage change_, _Candidate archive state change_, _Candidate hired_, _Interview created_, _Interview updated_ and _Interview deleted_ webhooks in Lever by going to **Settings** \> **Integrations and API** \> [**Webhooks**](https://hire.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=webhooks).
    :::tip
    If the webhooks don't appear in Lever's [**Webhooks**](https://hire.lever.co/settings/integrations?tab=webhooks)-tab, you can reset them manually by clicking the _Reset Webhooks_-icon in the [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations)-tab of Embloy's Recruiter Dashboard.
    :::

    ![Lever Webhook Page](/img/integrations/lever/lever-webhooks.png)

:::warning
Since Lever doesnâ€™t provide a webhook for updates of your postingsâ€™ application forms, we automatically fetch your jobs every 12 hours.

Whenever you create or edit a posting, and you donâ€™t want to wait for it to re-synchronize automatically, you can trigger this manually by pressing the â€˜Refresh postingsâ€™-icon in the [**Integrations**](https://genius.embloy.com/settings?tab=integrations)-tab of Embloyâ€™s Recruiter Dashboard.
:::

## Step 4: Using the Embloy integration

1. Navigate to **Settings** > [**Posting Templates**](https://hire.lever.co/settings/site?tab=posting-templates).

    ![Lever Webhook Page](/img/integrations/lever/lever-template.png)

2. Create a new template or update an existing one with the following text that links to `https://apply.embloy.com/lever`: 
    > **To speed up your application, apply with [Embloy](https://embloy.com) to this position. Simply paste the URL of this job posting into [apply.embloy.com/lever](https://apply.embloy.com/lever).**

    ![Lever Webhook Page](/img/integrations/lever/lever-template-content.png)

3. Save the template and use it in your job postings.

4. Users should now be able to apply to your postings using their Embloy account by pressing _Apply with Embloy_.

## Conclusion

### Receive applications via your ATS

- Now that you have connected your ATS, applications submitted through Embloy will automatically be sent there so that you can process your applications as usual.

:::tip
Applications submitted through Embloy will include an `Embloy` tag in your Lever dashboard.
:::

- If you need to, you can also log into our [recruiter portal](https://genius.embloy.com/), screen the applications and respond to the candidates directly. However, if you are using Embloy as an integration and not as a standalone tool, we recommend you to manage your applications directly via your ATS.
