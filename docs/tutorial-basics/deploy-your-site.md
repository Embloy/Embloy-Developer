# Deploy your site

You can now deploy your site.

## Build your site

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `.next` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

The `.next` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `.next` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost.
