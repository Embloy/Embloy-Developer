Hello Everyone,

we're delighted to share that Embloy's Developer Docs have just made their debut!

Embloy is designed to be a universal application gateway that allows everyone to apply for any job on any website, all within the simplicity of a single account and minimal integration overhead (< 10 LOC).

<!--truncate-->

Now, let's get back to the Docs. Within, you'll find quick-start guides, our SDKs, examples ready for implementation, and a comprehensive guide on how to integrate Embloy with your projects.

The essence of Embloy lies in its continuous evolution. It's not just a product; Embloy's a work in progress that thrives on your input. Expect frequent updates, refinements, and perhaps a few delightful surprises and ~~bugs~~ _features_ along the way.

Whether you're here to learn more about how Embloy works, contribute your coding skills, or simply enjoy finding _features_...

Happy coding,

Embloy Team
