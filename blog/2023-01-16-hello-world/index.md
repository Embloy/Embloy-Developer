Hello Everyone,

we're delighted to share that Embloy's Developer Docs have just made their debut!

Embloy is designed to be a universal application gateway that allows everyone to apply for any job on any website, all within the simplicity of a single account and minimal integration overhead (< 10 LOC).

<!--truncate-->

Now, let's get back to the Docs. Within, you'll find a quick [starter guide](/docs/intro), our [SDKs](/docs/sdks/overview), [tutorials](/docs/category/tutorial---basics) with examples ready for implementation, and [comprehensive guides](/docs/category/guides) on how to integrate Embloy with your projects.

Expect frequent updates, refinements, and perhaps a few delightful surprises and ~~bugs~~ _features_ along the way.
Whether you're here to learn more about how Embloy works, contribute your coding skills, or simply enjoy finding _features_...

Happy coding,

Embloy Team
